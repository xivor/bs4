#### Configure UI/UX Settings

###### Suppress Objective Achievements:

Removes the achievement tracking and list from the achievement Watch List on general objectives.

**Suppress Objective Quests:**

Removes the achievement tracking and list from the achievement Watch List related to quests such as Personal Story.

**Suppress Objective Events:**

Removes the achievement tracking and list from the achievement Watch List related to nearby events. This should be displayed for WvW, as removing this will remove the structure defense event that gives a timer to when the structure's waypoint will be available.

**Suppress Floating Combat Text:**

Text related to damage, healing, and effects will no longer appear. This can significantly clean up the amount of clutter during a fight.

**Save/Restore Some Profession Keybinds:**

Unknown and untested at this time. Leave unchecked.

**Check Recommended Minimum Version:**

If this option is checked a window will pop-up when starting Guild Wars 2 that the versions are not compatible and will contain known accuracy issues or bugs. If unchecked, a warning will not display. It is highly recommended to use an updated version of ArcDPS to avoid inaccuracies and crashes.

**TTS for NPC's:**

Unknown and untested at this time. Leave unchecked.
