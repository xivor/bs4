## Understand ArcDPS's Hook

ArcDPS is a third-party developer add-on for Guild Wars 2 that provides statistics during a battle, and can be recorded into a report form to be viewed later. <!--more-->It is developed by [Deltaconnnected](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/), and it **utilizes a hook with client network data** to have access to functions within the Guild Wars 2 program.

## GW2 Code of Conduct

This method of data extraction **appears** to be in direct violation of rules 15 and 20 of the [Guild Wars 2 – Rules of Conduct](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/).

> 15.) You will not attempt to interfere with, hack into, or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running *Guild Wars* 2.
>
>
> 20.) You may not use any third-party program (such as a “bot”) in order to automate gameplay functions, including playing, chatting, interacting, or gathering gold or items within *Guild Wars 2*. You may not assist, relay, or store gold or items for other players who are using these processes.

## Chris Cleary's Declaration

Chris Cleary, a member of ArenaNet has given clarity on DPS Meters on Reddit. Sources:

> 1.) [Reddit AMA, Chris Cleary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5svug8/the_head_of_the_snake_devs_here_ask_us_anything/ddi8p8y/?context=0) – Wednesday, February 8, 2017 (17:28:52 EST)

> You are correct. Combat data is defined as any information that is created due to the usage of skills or impact on players due to skill usage (by the player/s or an outside source).
>
>
> Edit/Update: These statements are particularly targeted at a “DPS Meter” or functionality built around the capture of combat data. Features outside of that most likely fall under “Quality of Life” changes and should be removed from DPS meters if they want to be considered compliant with our rules.

> ArenaNet authorizes the use and development of 3rd Party tools under the banner of a “DPS Meter”. “DPS Meters” is defined as the collection and processing of combat related data in order to develop a statistical and visual representation of that data. This combat data maybe collected from anyone inside of your immediate social group. Social groups are defined as including the player character, and current party and/or squad.
>
>
> Combat data does not include current entity status, including current Buffs/Debuffs/Health/Stats/Location or any other data that is not generated due to the usage of skills or impact on player characters due to skill usage (by the PC/s or an outside source).
>
>
> The collection and processing of data in the client must be limited to the scope of the “DPS meter” and should not exceed it. Visualization of this data must also limited to the scope of the “DPS Meter” which includes visualizations, logging, and processing/visualization of logging.

## What Does This All Mean?

The developer of ArcDPS, Deltaconnected, has ensured that ArcDPS has been developed within ArenaNet’s guidelines, in order for the application to be considered acceptable by ArenaNet. With regular updates, ArcDPS is still a commonly used tool among GW2 players, especially among those that regularly participate in highly coordinated gameplay, such as Raids and WvW.

Players that are interested in using ArcDPS do so at their own risk.
