#### Installation

This piece of documentation goes over the easiest and most concise method of installing ArcDPS Boon Table and maintaining an updated installation. This method uses an additional 3rd party utility called [The GW2 Unofficial Addon Manager](https://github.com/fmmmlee/GW2-Addon-Manager)(GW2-UOAOM).

Make sure that Guild Wars 2 is not running at the time of installation. For ArcDPS Boon Table to function, there needs to be two addons installed: **ArcDPS** and **ArcDPS Boon Table**. There are many other addons available for install with this utility, but will not cover those in this guide.

1. Make sure that the game path is set correctly (the default is C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2)
2. Select the **ArcDPS** add on and the **ArcDPS Boon Table** add-on (ignore any other addons at this time, as they are unnecessary for ArcDPS operation)
3. Click the large **UPDATE** button on the lower right
4. At this time, **GW2-UOAOM** will download and install the latest version of **ArcDPS** and the **ArcDPS Boon Table**.

#### Window Access

Use **Alt+Shift+B** to access the ArcDPS Boon Table window or press **Alt+Shift+T** and select it from the ArcDPS options menu.
