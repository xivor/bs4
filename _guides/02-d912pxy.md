## What is {{page.title}}?

[{{page.title}}](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy)is a third-party application that is used to {{page.description | downcase}}.<!--more-->  d912pxy takes DirectX 9 API calls and translates them into DirectX 12 API calls. This allows for considerable performance increases, such as allowing GW2 to use multiple CPU cores for greater CPU optimization, unlocks VRAM usage for additional memory allocation, and more reliance on GPU for greater graphical bandwidth optimization. This assists some in playing WvW at max graphics with little lag.

## Installation

This piece of documentation goes over the easiest and most concise method of installing d912pxy and maintaining an updated installation. This method uses an additional 3rd party utility called [The GW2 Unofficial Addon Manager ](https://github.com/fmmmlee/GW2-Addon-Manager)(GW2-UOAOM). 


Make sure that Guild Wars 2 is not running at the time of installation. For d912pxy to function, the only addon needed is the one labeled **d912pxy**. There are many other addons available for install with this utility, but will not cover those in this guide.

1. Make sure that the game path is set correctly (the default is C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2)
2. Select the **d912pxy** addon (ignore any other addons at this time, as they are unnecessary for d912pxy operation)
3. Click the large **UPDATE** button on the lower right
4. At this time, GW2-UOAOM will download and install the latest version of d912pxy.
